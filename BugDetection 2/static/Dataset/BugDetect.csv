SUPPORT.MOZILLA.ORG-398246,General,SUPPORT.MOZILLA.ORG,Add support for custom cookies and cache headers,"Adding support for custom headers and cookie names involves two steps:
* making session names configurable
* disabling auto-start for sessions

This can be accomplished in tiki-setup_base.php though it means in turn that all pages dependent on the hard-coded PHPSESSID cookie along with the basic session handler all need to be refactored to not assume there is a pre-existing session.

I'm looking at re-implementing some session libs I have from before.  Should do the trick.

This is a chicken/egg problem since we want to use non-default cookie names for NS rules.  We can't have the app auto-setting the cookie while simultaneously passing cache headers.  We need to separate the behavior so it's consistent and predictable for the proxy cache.

***

The ProcessData function of the nsXBMDecoder class parse the data of an XBM's
format image.
The bug happens during the re-processing of this image format within the
libpr0n a module activated by default :

At [1] endPtr is incremented until the null terminating character if it's
fill by ' ' space.
At [2] mPos is set to endPtr if mIsX10 and hiByte are null. There are option
taken from the XBM format's image.
At [3] mPos is incremented without checking if *mPos is null.
Thus the boucle at [4] can not stop depending on the state of the heap.

I found it is possible to craft such an XBM image to put the heap layout in
a predictable state and exploit the bug reliably.

An attacker could execute arbitrary code on mozilla firefox if a web page is
viewed or even within an e-mail with a IFRAME tag.

As you can see the image end with a space character when the program assume
the image to be clean and contain end tag.
Thus if one is able to control the heap layout it is possible to execute
arbitrary code.

Here is some details on how to exploit the bug on Linux :

- Use a javascript and allocate a lot of 'local' buffer. I found JC_GC is called
at the end of the javascript parsing before any image are loaded and will free
all 'useless' (because local) buffer.
Thus it is easy to 1) Allocate in some global array a lot of *little bufer* to
begin so we have the heap layout in a predictable state (no hole).
2) Allocate a few big buffer with isdigit()-valid character. Because there is no
more heap hole the 'top chunk' of the heap is expended.
3) When JC_GC return some memory have been freed and thus following
allocation will fall in these new heap hole.
4) When the image is processed the overflowed buffer will be followed by
isdigit-character (this is junk in the prev_size field of the next struct
malloc_chunk). Then a '\0' will be written on the LSB of the 'next size' field
of the next struct malloc_chunk on the heap.
Because it is easily possible to inject controlled character on the heap
(actually that could have been done in the few isdigit()-valid buffer) it is
possible to store fake information on the heap and tricks malloc()/free()/etc
to parse them.
Still in the scheme of Doug Lea malloc (linux) this will end by triggering the
macro UNLINK() which basically insert a heap chunk in a linked list thus
writing a controlled pointer of us to a controlled address of us.
One can simply overwrite any function pointer like GOT entry saved %eip
pointer on the stack and hijack it to point to some injected shellcode.

Exploitation is possible on *BSD / Windows aswell.

When scrolling into not visible content on an element that has overflow:auto

This bug might be the same as closed bug 172227 but that one has been fixed so
I was suggested to open a new one.

Assertion failure: cg->stackDepth >= 0 at jsemit.c:164

The root cause is this error handling in jsemit:

#define EMIT_ATOM_INDEX_OP(op atomIndex)                                     \

EmitAtomIndexOp returns a JSBool so any error returned will actually be ignored by mistake leading to the assert fail later.

SEAMONKEY-208903,Download & File Handling,SEAMONKEY,download manager doesn't work with non-ASCII file names.,"The patch for bug 175881 introudced this problem. (attachment 124826).
The patch has the following line 

-    gStatusBar.label = getSelectedItem().id
+    gStatusBar.label = getFileForItem(getSelectedItem()).path

The noticable change introduced by this is that the status bar shows 'garbage'
characters for non-ASCII file names. Going back to 
|getSelectedItem().id| (chopping off 'file://' at the beginning if necessary)
will solve this 'UI' regression. However that's not touching the root cause of
the problem because none of command buttons is functional (all of them is dimmed
out) when a non-ASCII file is  selected  with or without the change. The file
operation in other parts of Mozilla work fine so that nsIFile and nsILocalFile
are not to blame. [1]

getFileForItem() is defined in 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/components/download-manager/resources/downloadmanager.js#357
as
357 function getFileForItem(aElement)
358 {

I added a couple of 'dump()' statements in createLocalFile(aFilePath) and
printed out |aFilePath).  aFilePath is zero-extended UTF-8. For instance 
U+00A0 (in UTF-8 it's 0xC2 0x80) aFilePath should have 'U+00A0'. Instead it
has 'U+00C2 U+0080'. This symptom suggests that somewhere in RDF-related code
ACString is used where AUTF8String should have been used. 

[1] Recently I've been working on enabling 'Unicode' file I/O in Windows (bug
162361) and with that enabled Mozilla-Windows has the same problem as Linux

The HTTP ACCEPT header is not preserved when after a GET redirect. That leads that the second GET is not using the original HTTP ACCEPT header but is reset to the standard.

This is a really important feature for the proper implementation of RESTful architectures. I'm currently developing some RESTful prototypes and this feature is a must when dealing with aliasing of resources for instance in order to access resources by their ID or any other resource key field (as its unique name). The problem is that the http accept header in particular is very important to determine the proper format to de-reference to the resource to (as when using Ruby on Rails respond_to in order to determine the content-type to respond with).

On the test page the border on the top and left sides of the table disappears.
It actually appears as if the border disappears halfway in under the
content/background och the cells. If the border is 4px wide 2 pixels will be
visible at all sides of the table. If the border is 2px wide 1 pixel will be

FIREFOX-420556,Theme,FIREFOX,sidebarheader on GNOME has a transparent background,"Created attachment 306847
patch v1: fixes problem

The sidebar header on GNOME has a transparent background because its -moz-appearance: toolbox rule overrides its background-color: -moz-Dialog rule which causes problems for theming engines like Personas that expect the header to have an explicit background color as it does on Mac and Windows.

The -moz-appearance rule also overrides rules specifying top and bottom borders and it's unclear why there are these contradictory rules but the rules are the same as in winstripe where -moz-appearance does not override the other rules so perhaps they were simply copied from Windows to Linux verbatim.

In that case the intent would have been for the header to have the specified background color -moz-Dialog which we can do by simply removing the -moz-appearance.  Nevertheless that also causes the explicit border rules to be applied and I looked at three other GNOME apps with sidebars (Totem gThumb and Evolution) and none of them give their sidebar headers borders (although Evolution gives it a different background color).

Plus borders look funky with the native GTK splitter which is borderless.  So I think the header should remain borderless while fixing the background color issue which we can do by removing both the -moz-appearance rule and the top and bottom border rules.

Here's a patch that does that.

Note: there are other things I noticed while investigating this issue like that we use a widget (sidebarheader) with no XBL binding that we put its styles in toolkit/ instead of browser/ on Linux and Windows (it's in browser/ on Mac although there's at least one funky rule there as well) and that we pad the header label by four pixels on the left which causes it to be misaligned with text in the sidebar itself (f.e. the Search label in the Bookmarks sidebar).

But I'll file those as separate bugs.

The aim of that page is to provide web access to our University library's
catalogue. When you open the page you'll see the yellow square with several
fields and buttons. There is only one text field (for entering the search
phrase). Enter something there for example physics and press Ok button. In
Mozilla 0.9.9 and earlier versions and Internet Explorer you'll receive a list

new page loads but it contains no books info it's just the same as the page
what you see before submission (pay attention to the text just under the yellow
square in English it should looks like: 'XXX mathes found. Your query was:
'. As one can suppose after submitting a form this should be
like: 'XXX mathes found. Your query was physics' but in 1.0RC1 we actually
have '0 mathes found. Your query was:  ').
My little test shows that the difference between information sent on submission
in 0.9.9 and 1.0RC1 is that 0.9.9 sends 'ssub1=find' name-value pair when 'Ok'
button is pressed ('Ok' button is actually an image and has an OnClick event
document.forms[0].submit()) but 1.0RC1 does'nt. Maybe a server script

This is particularly evident when an op pings out what tends to happen is that you get join auto-op part and nick changes in quick succession which seems to kill my CPU.

The main thrust of my proposal is changing the tree from a content view to a builder view achieved by setting flags=dont-build-content on the tree. This already allows us to automatically sort when switching channel or when new nicks join a channel. The sort order is initialized once and then the tree maintains its sort although this can of course be toggled. Nick (and op changes in sort by op mode) are handled by removing and reinserting the nick.

Calls to updateUserList are therefore removed in setCurrentObject my_cjoin my_cmode and my_cnick although in the latter two cases calls to _removeUserFromGraph and _addUserToGraph are used to maintain the nick list.

I changed setListMode to clear the tree cache directly it appeared to be relying on some unknown side effect for its attribute change to take effect.

The only other change necessary in the current code was the code that extracts the nick from a given tree row as the builder view does not permit arbitrary attributes I had to extract the unicode name from the RDF data source. However the reverse operation of obtaining the tree row from a nick is simplified to tree.builderView.getIndexOfResource(nick.getGraphResource()).

I'm not sure what style is preferred so I tested for nsITreeColumn in my new sortUserList() method although I have only tested it on 1.8+ so far.",gijskruitbosch+bugs,neil,fixed,1,resolved,4,1,14,758,normal,2

When clicking on the magnifying glass for notes in a test run the context of the screen resets to the top. That is the run screen goes to the top of the page immediately when clicking on the magnifying glass. The notes page pops up at the same time. (normal) It would be a bit nicer if on the run page you stayed at the location of the test case from which you hit the magnifying glass button. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to runs.
2. expand a case
3. click on magnifying glass
Actual Results:  
1. new notes window pops up.
2. run page resets to the top

Expected Results:  
1. new notes window pops up.
2. run page stays at the test case from which you cliced on the magnifying glass",gregaryh,keith.mcfall,fixed,1,resolved,4,0,2,106,trivial,1

However many scripts have the second argument in that function.
And contributors do not stop using that wrong style for more than 4 years.

MAILNEWS_CORE-186977,Backend,MAILNEWS_CORE,Message folder pane shows folder size in MB but also in kb (all lowercase),"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.3b) Gecko/20021227
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows U Windows NT 5.0 en-US rv:1.3b) Gecko/20021227

With bug 173825 a message folder size column was introduced to the folder pane.
Depending on the size of each folder it shows kb or MB. In that other bug
there is no obvious reason why a lowercase b is used for the unit Bytes. So
I think this was an accidental slip and it should be changed to KB.

Four reasons why I think this should be changed:
- It looks odd (see screenshot I'll attach)
- It is the same unit so why use different case?
- b is often used for bits not bytes but from the source I see here it
means bytes
- From lxr I see Mozilla always uses KB for kilobytes (e.g. in the message
pane where the user sees it simultaneously which is even more confusing...) so
it should be used here also for consistency.

(The uppercase K (used everywhere else) should be ok here because it stands
for a factor 1024 (as usual): there is a distinction (that at least some make)
between K for 1024 and (defined by the metric system) k for 1000.)

Although this bug is visible at the front end I chose the back end component
because the affected code seems to be pretty far inside mail. Feel free to
change if I'm wrong...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open mail window with some big (> 1 MB) and some small (< 1 MB) message
folders visible
2. Make sure the Size column is shown in the folder pane (the left one)


Actual Results:  
Folder size is shown in kb and MB.

Expected Results:  
Folder size should be shown in KB and MB.",mscott,durbacher,fixed,1,resolved,4,0,13,19,trivial,1
